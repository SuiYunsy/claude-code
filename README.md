# @yetnpm/claude-code

Claude Code restored for Node.js — extracted from official Bun SEA binaries and patched for Node.js runtime compatibility.

Starting from v2.1.113, Anthropic ships Claude Code as native Bun binaries instead of Node.js-runnable JavaScript. This project restores the npm package format so it can run under Node.js.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @yetnpm/claude-code
```

## What it does

1. Downloads official Claude Code binaries from all 8 platforms (darwin/linux/win32 × arm64/x64)
2. Extracts the embedded JavaScript and native modules from Bun SEA format
3. Patches the code for Node.js compatibility (hardcoded paths, Bun-only APIs, module loading)
4. Reassembles into a standard npm package with `vendor/` dependencies

## Compatibility patches

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| P1 | `fileURLToPath`/`createRequire` hardcoded build paths → `__filename`/`require` |
| P2 | `Bun.Transpiler` guard → graceful null return |
| P3 | `/$bunfs/root/` native module requires → `vendor/` fallback |
| P5 | `EMBEDDED_SEARCH_TOOLS` guard restored — enables Grep/Glob Tool by default; set `EMBEDDED_SEARCH_TOOLS=true` to switch to bfs/ugrep Bash shadow mode (auto-detects binary availability) |
| P6 | Bun polyfill shim injection (global Bun API stubs) |
| P7 | `HttpsProxyAgent` exposed on `globalThis` for Node.js ws proxy support |
| P8 | `AF_()` shadow function patched — resolves system `bfs`/`ugrep` via `which` instead of ARGV0 multicall |

## Search tools

Claude Code has two search paths, controlled by the `EMBEDDED_SEARCH_TOOLS` environment variable:

| Mode | Env setting | Search method | Requirements |
|------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Tool mode** (default) | unset | Grep/Glob Tool → ripgrep (bundled) | None |
| **Shadow mode** | `=true` | Bash `find` → bfs, `grep` → ugrep | bfs + ugrep installed |

In Tool mode, the model uses the built-in Grep and Glob tools powered by bundled ripgrep. In Shadow mode, `find`/`grep` commands in the Bash tool are redirected to bfs/ugrep for enhanced search.

If `EMBEDDED_SEARCH_TOOLS=true` is set but bfs/ugrep are not installed, it automatically falls back to Tool mode.

```bash
# Tool mode (default, recommended)
claude

# Shadow mode (requires: brew install bfs ugrep)
EMBEDDED_SEARCH_TOOLS=true claude
```
